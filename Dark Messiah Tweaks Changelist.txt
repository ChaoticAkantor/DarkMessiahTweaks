Dark Messiah Mod
Changelist:

Altered some item descriptions to highlight or add information. Work in progress.

<<<Weapons>>>
Swords all require Combat skill to use.
Shields all require Combat skill to use.
Bows all require Archery skill to use.
Daggers all require Stealth skill to use.
Staves all require Magic Affinity skill to use.

All bows got a 300% range increase. Projectile trajectory unchanged.
bow_classic - Damage increased.
bow_collector - Damage increased. Collectors weapon, aquired in the tutorial if you can find it!
bow_explosive - Larger explosive radius, more explosive damage, now has a very long charge time. Most poweful enchanted.
bow_freeze - Damage increased, enchant recharges faster, freeze duration reduced - can create up to 5 ice puddles for enemies to slip on.
Polar daggers can not do this (hence low freeze duration).
bow_holy - Unaltered. Still most powerful vs undead.
bow_long - Damage increased.
bow_plan - Damage increased.
bow_poison - Damage increased, more powerful poison and longer duration. 
Poison does not kill however, only brings afflicted to 1hp like toxin in HL2.
bow_sniper - Damage greatly increased, doubled crit chance. Most powerful non-enchanted bow.

sword_collector - Collectors weapon, no changes. Aquired in the tutorial if you can find it!
sword_long - Damage increased.
sword_of_fire - Unchanged.
sword_orc - Unchanged.
sword_sareth - Unchanged.
sword_short - Damage increased.
sword_silver - Holy weapon, unchanged. Already very powerful vs undead.
sword_souldrinker - Damage increased, fixed health steal to drain 30% as tooltip claims, rather than 10%.
sword_wakizashi - Damage increased.
sword_wakizashi_ex - Crit chance increased.

daggers_ash - Holy weapon, unchanged. Already very powerful vs undead.
daggers_collector - Unchanged. Collectors weapon, aquired in the tutorial if you can find it!
daggers_kryss - Damage increased, poison has longer duration (Reminder: Poison does not kill!), enchant recharges faster. These things require stealth 3! Default was way too underpowered!
daggers_kryss_lk - Damage increased and crit chance doubled for lack of poison. (Poison for debuff DoT, gutting for burst/crit)
daggers_light - Enchantment here is unique in that it has no recharge, damage unchanged but lightning damage was increased. Attack speed is slower to balance it out.
daggers_plan - Collectors weapon, no changes. Aquired in the tutorial if you can find it!
daggers_polar - Damage increased, faster enchant recharge, freeze duration unchanged. Unable to create floor puddles, not as much utility as ice bow so needs faster regen.
daggers_shadow - Damage increased, attack speed increased, added crit chance. Stealth 3, aquired late game, these things were way under powered. NOT ANYMORE!

staff_collector - Damage increased.
staff_combat - Damage increased.
staff_fire - Damage increased.
staff_ghost - Apparently a copy of staff_collector as of yet unchanged.
staff_holy - Unchanged, already very poweful vs undead.
staff_mana - Damage increased. 50% of damage is returned as mana.
staff_shadow - Damage increased.
staff_spell - Damage increased, can now use THREE times once charged. This staff blocks spells to charge the lightning enchant and then release it on a power attack.

Note on regen values:
They multiply the BASE regeneration amount,
so the skills that increase base amount regenerated will vastly improve on the regen bonuses.

<<<Armor>>> Ascending rarity & class

Warrior armor requires Endurance to use.
Mage armor requires Magic Affinity to use.
Assassin armor requires Stealth to use.

All warrior armors got +1AC extra to help with tanking on harder difficulties, 
they have the best HP regen multipliers.

	chainmail -	+3AC, x0.25MP regen, x2HP regen

	plate - +4AC, x0.5MP regen, x2.5HP regen, +1 constitution

	shadowsteel - +5AC, x1.25MP regen, x3HP regen, +2 constitution
	
Wizard robes have much higher MP regen multipliers than other armors.

	wizard robe - +1AC, x2MP regen, x0.5HP regen (was 1x but not on arcane), +1 intelligence

	arcane robe - +2AC, x3MP regen, x1HP regen, +2 intelligence

Assassin/Thief armors are the only sets that have stealth bonuses.

	assassins - +2AC, x1HP regen, x1MP regen
	
	master thief - 	+3AC, x2HP regen, x2MP regen
	
<<<Rings>>>

	Health Regeneration - Untouched, modifies base regen amount (makes modifiers on armor stronger).
	Ring of Fire - Unchanged. 25% fire resist.
	Mana Regeneration - Added x2MP regen, kept +1 intelligence

<<<Spells>>>
Work in progress.


<<<Items>>>
None as of yet.

To Do - Scrolls/Potions

<<<Skills>>>
	Xana mode +1 AC, x2HP, x2MP, +3 Int


<<<Difficulty>>>

	Enemy HP: 
HP across all difficulties has been lowered. 
1.5x for normal (was 2).
1.2x for hard/hardcore (was 3). 
Does not account for dynamic difficulty (which should have a greater effect the higher the difficulty).
Enemy damages are untouched. They will still kick your ass on harder difficulties.

	Poison: 
Can no longer be stacked on the player.
Once poisoned, there is a 10 second delay before you can be poisoned again.
Should stop zombies and spiders from constantly poisoning you, it was rendering your antidotes useless!
